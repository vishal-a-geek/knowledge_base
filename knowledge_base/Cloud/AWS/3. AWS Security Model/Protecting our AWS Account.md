#aws #cloud 
- Secure credentials
- Use Multi-Factor Authentication
- Utilise IAM Users
	- IAM Users are users which we can create in our account which then can be used to login
	- We can create IAM user account if we want to share access to our AWS account, instead of sharing our own credentials
	- Every colleague should use a separate IAM User account
