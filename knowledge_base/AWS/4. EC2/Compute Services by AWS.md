- **EC2**: Elastic Compute Cloud
	- Allows to rent a virtual remote server / computer
	- Fully configurable
		- Decide on operating system
		- Decide any software on top of them
		- Fully configurable as if they are computers standing in our room
	- Thus very powerfully service
- **ECS / EKS** : Elastic Container Service / Elastic Kubernetes Service
	- An alternative for EC2 - for containerised workloads
	- Supporting environments are still computers / servers, on which we need not manually install docker anywhere and configure it, but instead just use images to deploy
- **Lambda**: Serverless service
