- AWS Security Model has a name called **Shared Responsibility Model**
- Key principle of this model:
	- Security is a shared responsibility
	- Shared between AWS and us
		- AWS
			- AWS secures the infrastructure and physical machines
			- Protects their internal systems and processes
			- Secures managed services and everything not under our control
		- Us
			- Secure our application and workloads
			- Say, if we are renting a server from AWS and installing a software on that server, it is our responsibility to check if the software doesn't have any security holes
			- Protect everything in our control
