Spark will **wait** until the very last moment to execute the graph of computation instructions

In Spark, instead of modifying the data immediately, when we express some operation, we **build up a plan** of transformations that we would like to apply to source data

By waiting until the last minute to execute the code, Spark compiles the transformation plan on raw DataFrame to a streamlined physical plan that will run as efficiently as possible across the cluster

This provides immense benefits because Spark can optimise the entire data flow from end to end
