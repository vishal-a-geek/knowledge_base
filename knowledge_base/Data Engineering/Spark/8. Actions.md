#spark 
[[6. Transformations|Transformations]] allow us to build plan for performing a set transformation(s), e.g.
- first filter, 
- then count 
- get max value
All of these transformations will be stacked on each other but won't get executed just yet, just while creating transformations

Spark waits for any **action** to be invoked on the data frame for performing any transformation on the DataFrame
	This waiting is called [[7. Lazy Evaluation|Lazy Evaluation]]
